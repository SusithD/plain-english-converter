# 02. Design System: Clarity & Illumination

This document outlines the high-fidelity design system for the "Plain English Converter." It's tailored for implementation in Figma and the application's codebase.

## Design Philosophy

Our design direction is guided by the principle of **"Clarity & Illumination."** The user experience should feel like a complex, foggy idea is being clarified and brought into the light. We aim to build trust and create a sense of calm, focused productivity.

### Core Principles

1.  **Sophisticated Simplicity:** The UI is clean, uncluttered, and focuses the user on the core task of conversion and comprehension. We use a "Soft Minimalist" aesthetic with generous whitespace to let content breathe.
2.  **Tangible & Luminous:** We blend physical and digital metaphors. The interface feels like interacting with crisp, high-quality paper, but is enhanced with soft, diffused light, blurs, and gentle glows.
3.  **Creative & Confident:** We deliberately avoid standard corporate aesthetics. Our brand expression is unique and memorable, using a distinctive color and typography pairing to convey creativity and intelligence.

## Visual Metaphor

-   **Background:** The main app background is a warm, off-white, reminiscent of high-grade, uncoated paper stock. This reduces glare and eye strain during long reading sessions.
-   **Surfaces:** Interactive elements like cards and modals are pure white, appearing to float above the background with soft, subtle shadows. This creates a clear visual hierarchy.
-   **Sticky Elements:** Headers or other sticky UI elements use a "glassmorphism" effect (background blur) to create a sense of depth and maintain context without being distracting.
-   **Light & Glow:** Accent colors and interactive feedback use soft glows and shimmers, reinforcing the "illumination" concept.
